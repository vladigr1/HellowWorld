# Advance Uses of Shell

Shell have many advance tools and we will talk here about:

* Terminal Multiplexers 
* Alias
* Dotfiles
* Remote Machines

## tmux

Keybinding form in tmux is _<C-b>x_ which mean 

1. press `ctrl-b`
2. release `ctrl-b`
3. press `x`

Sessions is a independent worspace with one or more windwos

* tmux starts a new session.
* tmux new -s NAME starts it with that name.
* tmux ls lists the current sessions
* Within tmux typing <C-b> d detaches the current session
* tmux a attaches the last session. You can use -t flag to specify which
* 
* ows - Equivalent to tabs in editors or browsers, they are visually separate parts of the same session
* 
* <C-b> c Creates a new window. To close it you can just terminate the shells doing <C-d>
* <C-b> N Go to the N th window. Note they are numbered
* <C-b> p Goes to the previous window
* <C-b> n Goes to the next window
* <C-b> , Rename the current window
* <C-b> w List current windows

Panes like vim splits, panes let you have mmultiple shells in the same visual display.

    <C-b> " Split the current pane horizontally
    <C-b> % Split the current pane vertically
    <C-b> <direction> Move to the pane in the specified direction. Direction here means arrow keys.
    <C-b> z Toggle zoom for the current pane
    <C-b> [ Start scrollback. You can then press <space> to start a selection and <enter> to copy that selection.
    <C-b> <space> Cycle through pane arrangements.
    
For further reading,
here is a quick tutorial on tmux and this has a more detailed explanation that covers the original screen command.
You might also want to familiarize yourself with screen,
since it comes installed in most UNIX systems.

## Aliases

short form for another command that your shell will replace automatically for you.

note:there is no space around the equal sing `=`, because alias is a shell command that takes a single arument
```bash
# Make shorthands for common flags
alias ll="ls -lh"

# Save a lot of typing for common commands
alias gs="git status"
alias gc="git commit"
alias v="vim"

# Save you from mistyping
alias sl=ls

# Overwrite existing commands for better defaults
alias mv="mv -i"           # -i prompts before overwrite
alias mkdir="mkdir -p"     # -p make parent dirs as needed
alias df="df -h"           # -h prints human readable format

# Alias can be composed
alias la="ls -A"
alias lla="la -l"

# To ignore an alias run it prepended with \
\ls
# Or disable an alias altogether with unalias
unalias la

# To get an alias definition just call it with alias
alias ll
# Will print ll='ls -lh'
```

## Dotfiles

configuration using plain-text files known as dotfiles

How should you organize your dotfiles? They should be in their own folder, under version control, and symlinked into place using a script. This has the benefits of:

* Easy installation: if you log in to a new machine, applying your customizations will only take a minute.
* Portability: your tools will work the same way everywhere.
* Synchronization: you can update your dotfiles anywhere and keep them all in sync.
* Change tracking: you’re probably going to be maintaining your dotfiles for your entire programming career, and version history is nice to have for long-lived projects.

you can find tons of dotfiles repositories on Github — see the most popular one 
[here](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/command-line/)
(we advise you not to blindly copy configurations though). Here is another good resource on the topic.

All of the class instructors have their dotfiles publicly accessible on GitHub: 
[Anish](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles)
,
[Jon](https://github.com/jonhoo/configs)
, 
[Jose](https://github.com/jjgo/dotfiles)
.

## Portability


A common pain with dotfiles is that the configurations might not work when working with several machines, e.g. if they have different operating systems or shells. Sometimes you also want some configuration to be applied only in a given machine.

There are some tricks for making this easier. If the configuration file supports it, use the equivalent of if-statements to apply machine specific customizations. For example, your shell could have something like:

```bash
if [[ "$(uname)" == "Linux" ]]; then {do_something}; fi

# Check before using shell-specific features
if [[ "$SHELL" == "zsh" ]]; then {do_something}; fi

# You can also make it machine-specific
if [[ "$(hostname)" == "myServer" ]]; then {do_something}; fi
```

If the configuration file supports it, make use of includes. For example, a ~/.gitconfig can have a setting:

```bash
[include]
    path = ~/.gitconfig_local
```

And then on each machine, ~/.gitconfig_local can contain machine-specific settings. You could even track these in a separate repository for machine-specific settings.

This idea is also useful if you want different programs to share some configurations. For instance, if you want both bash and zsh to share the same set of aliases you can write them under .aliases and have the following block in both:

```bash
# Test if ~/.aliases exists and source it
if [ -f ~/.aliases ]; then
    source ~/.aliases
fi
```

## Remote Machines

It has become more and more common for programmers to use remote servers in their everyday work. If you need to use remote servers in order to deploy backend software or you need a server with higher computational capabilities, you will end up using a Secure Shell (SSH). As with most tools covered, SSH is highly configurable so it is worth learning about it.

To `ssh` into a server you execute a command as follows

```bash
ssh foo@bar.mit.edu
```

Here we are trying to ssh as user `foo` in server `bar.mit.edu`.
The server can be specified with a URL (like `bar.mit.edu`) or an IP (something like `foobar@192.168.1.42`). Later we will see that if we modify ssh config file you can access just using something like `ssh bar`.

### Executing commands

An often overlooked feature of `ssh` is the ability to run commands directly.
`ssh foobar@server ls` will execute `ls` in the home folder of foobar.
It works with pipes, so `ssh foobar@server ls | grep PATTERN` will grep locally the remote output of `ls` and `ls | ssh foobar@server grep PATTERN` will grep remotely the local output of `ls`.


### SSH Keys

Key-based authentication exploits public-key cryptography to prove to the server that the client owns the secret private key without revealing the key. This way you do not need to reenter your password every time. Nevertheless, the private key (often `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and more recently `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) is effectively your password, so treat it like so.

#### Key generation

To generate a pair you can run [`ssh-keygen`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh-keygen.1.html).
```bash
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
You should choose a passphrase, to avoid someone who gets hold of your private key to access authorized servers. Use [`ssh-agent`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh-agent.1.html) or [`gpg-agent`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/gpg-agent) so you do not have to type your passphrase every time.

If you have ever configured pushing to GitHub using SSH keys, then you have probably done the steps outlined [here](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) and have a valid key pair already. To check if you have a passphrase and validate it you can run `ssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/key`.

#### Key based authentication

`ssh` will look into `.ssh/authorized_keys` to determine which clients it should let in. To copy a public key over you can use:

```bash
cat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh foobar@remote 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
```

A simpler solution can be achieved with `ssh-copy-id` where available:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_ed25519.pub foobar@remote
```

### Copying files over SSH

There are many ways to copy files over ssh:

- `ssh+tee`, the simplest is to use `ssh` command execution and STDIN input by doing `cat localfile | ssh remote_server tee serverfile`. Recall that [`tee`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tee.1.html) writes the output from STDIN into a file.
- [`scp`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scp.1.html) when copying large amounts of files/directories, the secure copy `scp` command is more convenient since it can easily recurse over paths. The syntax is `scp path/to/local_file remote_host:path/to/remote_file`
- [`rsync`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rsync.1.html) improves upon `scp` by detecting identical files in local and remote, and preventing copying them again. It also provides more fine grained control over symlinks, permissions and has extra features like the `--partial` flag that can resume from a previously interrupted copy. `rsync` has a similar syntax to `scp`.

### Port Forwarding

In many scenarios you will run into software that listens to specific ports in the machine. When this happens in your local machine you can type `localhost:PORT` or `127.0.0.1:PORT`, but what do you do with a remote server that does not have its ports directly available through the network/internet?.

This is called _port forwarding_ and it
comes in two flavors: Local Port Forwarding and Remote Port Forwarding (see the pictures for more details, credit of the pictures from [this StackOverflow post](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/115897/whats-ssh-port-forwarding-and-whats-the-difference-between-ssh-local-and-remot)).

**Local Port Forwarding**
![Local Port Forwarding](https://i.stack.imgur.com/a28N8.png  "Local Port Forwarding")

**Remote Port Forwarding**
![Remote Port Forwarding](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4iK3b.png  "Remote Port Forwarding")

The most common scenario is local port forwarding, where a service in the remote machine listens in a port and you want to link a port in your local machine to forward to the remote port. For example, if we execute  `jupyter notebook` in the remote server that listens to the port `8888`. Thus, to forward that to the local port `9999`, we would do `ssh -L 9999:localhost:8888 foobar@remote_server` and then navigate to `locahost:9999` in our local machine.


### SSH Configuration

We have covered many many arguments that we can pass. A tempting alternative is to create shell aliases that look like
```bash
alias my_server="ssh -i ~/.id_ed25519 --port 2222 -L 9999:localhost:8888 foobar@remote_server
```

However, there is a better alternative using `~/.ssh/config`.

```bash
Host vm
    User foobar
    HostName 172.16.174.141
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    LocalForward 9999 localhost:8888

## Configs can also take wildcards
Host *.mit.edu
    User foobaz
```

An additional advantage of using the `~/.ssh/config` file over aliases  is that other programs like `scp`, `rsync`, `mosh`, &c are able to read it as well and convert the settings into the corresponding flags.


Note that the `~/.ssh/config` file can be considered a dotfile, and in general it is fine for it to be included with the rest of your dotfiles. However, if you make it public, think about the information that you are potentially providing strangers on the internet: addresses of your servers, users, open ports, &c. This may facilitate some types of attacks so be thoughtful about sharing your SSH configuration.

Server side configuration is usually specified in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Here you can make changes like disabling password authentication, changing ssh ports, enabling X11 forwarding, &c. You can specify config settings on a per user basis.

### Miscellaneous

A common pain when connecting to a remote server are disconnections due to shutting down/sleeping your computer or changing a network. Moreover if one has a connection with significant lag using ssh can become quite frustrating. [Mosh](https://mosh.org/), the mobile shell, improves upon ssh, allowing roaming connections, intermittent connectivity and providing intelligent local echo.

Sometimes it is convenient to mount a remote folder. [sshfs](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) can mount a folder on a remote server
locally, and then you can use a local editor.


## Shells & Frameworks

During shell tool and scripting we covered the `bash` shell because it is by far the most ubiquitous shell and most systems have it as the default option. Nevertheless, it is not the only option.

For example, the `zsh` shell is a superset of `bash` and provides many convenient features out of the box such as:

- Smarter globbing, `**`
- Inline globbing/wildcard expansion
- Spelling correction
- Better tab completion/selection
- Path expansion (`cd /u/lo/b` will expand as `/usr/local/bin`)

**Frameworks** can improve your shell as well. Some popular general frameworks are [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) or [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), and smaller ones that focus on specific features such as [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) or [zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search). Shells like [fish](https://fishshell.com/) include many of these user-friendly features by default. Some of these features include:

- Right prompt
- Command syntax highlighting
- History substring search
- manpage based flag completions
- Smarter autocompletion
- Prompt themes

One thing to note when using these frameworks is that they may slow down your shell, especially if the code they run is not properly optimized or it is too much code. You can always profile it and disable the features that you do not use often or value over speed.

## Terminal Emulators

Along with customizing your shell, it is worth spending some time figuring out your choice of **terminal emulator** and its settings. There are many many terminal emulators out there (here is a [comparison](https://anarc.at/blog/2018-04-12-terminal-emulators-1/)).

Since you might be spending hundreds to thousands of hours in your terminal it pays off to look into its settings. Some of the aspects that you may want to modify in your terminal include:

- Font choice
- Color Scheme
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Tab/Pane support
- Scrollback configuration
- Performance (some newer terminals like [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) or [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) offer GPU acceleration).
