# Exercise 3

You have a command that fails rarely.

```bash

 #!/usr/bin/env bash

 n=$(( RANDOM % 100 ))

 if [[ n -eq 42 ]]; then
    echo "Something went wrong"
    >&2 echo "The error was using magic numbers"
    exit 1
 fi

 echo "Everything went according to plan"

```
You must log std,error stream and report how many runs it took for the script to fail.

```bash

#!/usr/bin/env bash
>error.log #clear log
>std.log
while :; do
	($1) 1>> std.log 2>>error.log
	if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
		less ./std.log | wc -l
		break
	fi
done
```

note: streaming to the same file you must use\
` command1 >> log_file 2>&1 `
